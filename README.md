# RAG App â€“ PanScience Innovations Assignment

## Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that enables users to upload documents and query them. It uses:
- **Vector Database** for efficient document retrieval
- **LLM API** (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) for contextual answer generation
- **FastAPI** for REST API endpoints
- **Docker** for containerization and deployment

---

## Features
- Upload up to 20 documents (max 1000 pages each)
- Automatic chunking and vector embedding storage
- Query processing with top-k document retrieval
- API endpoints for uploading, querying, and viewing metadata
- Fully containerized for local and cloud deployment

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Vector DB:** ChromaDB
- **LLM API:** Configurable (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **Testing:** Postman

If you want, I can **directly prepare this file** for you now so you can just commit and push it to update your GitHub README.  
Do you want me to create this `README.md` file so you can just upload it?
